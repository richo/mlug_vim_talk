# NERD tree

Invoked with NERDTreeToggle
( Which I bind to \e in normal mode )

Support for fairly logical bindings

o: open node
t: tabopen node
s: vsplit open node
i: split open node
cd: change pwd to node
C: reroot NERD at node (I do a lot of cdC)

A couple of more advanced options ( I do not fully exploit it )

m to create nodes

# TODO

Add some todos
